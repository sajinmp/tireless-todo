## Tireless Todo

Tireless todo is not exactly a todo app per se. It can contain many lists probably of different types (read laters, bookmarks, side projects etc). The aim is to tireless pop up from time to time (interval is not decided) filling the screen reminding you of stuff that you wanted to get done. It can also serve as a list of bookmarks.

If possible, it can also sync the lists with a github repo or a gist containing the same.

#### Things done

* Create item
* Delete item

#### Things to do

* Persist the items in the native db
* Multiple lists
* Different list types (checklists, numbered and dotted probably)
* State of lists (Bookmarks - reference, Side projects - Force to do, Read laters - Non prioritized reminders etc)
* Sync with github repo or gist

I'm just starting react-native. Any advices would be greatly appreciated.
